# Variable naming

# 1. Variale names are case sensitive :- a and A are both different variable

a = 5
A = 10

# print(a)
# print(A)

# 2. The first character in the python variable name must be letter. Once past the first letter you can use any combination of letters upper or
# lower case, as well as numbers or the underscore character. A note here: Theere are special cases where a variable should begin with _

Avariable = 5

BVariable = 10

# 566fse = 12 - This gives syntax error

_country = "India"

print(_country)

# 3. Variables should not be reserved word like it range,while

# 4. Single line in python should be length of 79

x = None

# None represents variable without value
